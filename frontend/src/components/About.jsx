          ✨ Hi! I’m <strong>Rama Jeevitha R</strong>, <strong>Computer Science and Engineering</strong> student with a passion for designing intuitive interfaces and building Full-stack web applications. As a dedicated <strong>MERN & PERN STACK Developer</strong> and <strong> UX/UI Designer</strong>, I blend creativity with technical expertise to deliver seamless and engaging digital experiences. 🚀 Currently, I serve as a <strong>Student Ambassador @AICTE IDEA IAB</strong> and <strong>Ambassador @CodeBoosters</strong>, while also being an active <strong>QCFI Member</strong> and proud recipient of the <strong>Gold Award at QCFI 2024</strong>. 💡 My goal is to craft user-centered solutions that function flawlessly and delight users through thoughtful design. With hands-on experience in <strong>projects, hackathons, and leadership roles</strong>, I strive to bridge the gap between <strong>design and development</strong> while continuously exploring innovation-driven communities. 🌟 Beyond coding and design, I’m a passionate <strong>sports enthusiast</strong>, actively participating in athletics and team sports, which have helped me cultivate <strong>discipline, leadership, and teamwork</strong> — qualities I carry into every professional challenge I take on.
